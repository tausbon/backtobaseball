This script currently takes the input in the form of the Excel play-by-play file, exported from baseballreference.com, and exports a baseball scorecard in the form of test.pdf.
Highlighted in the Excel file are the play descriptions that are incorrectly abbreviated in the scorecard -- these problems I am still trying to solve and account for.
